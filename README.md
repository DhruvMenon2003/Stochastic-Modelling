# Stochastic-Modelling
# Simulation of Genetic Drift using Dice Roll
Genetic drift is a random fluctuation of allele frequency with a larger effect in smaller population over a large number of generations. Mathematically this makes sense because the standard error or variation goes down. But I tried to demonstrate this intuitively by designing a computer simulation on Matlab which requires one to specify the initial allele frequency, population size and no. of generations. I have used a binomial model which means we are focusing on the frequency of a single allele but the same reasoning could be generalized to multiple alleles using the multinomial distribution.
I have assumed independence as squashing insects for eg. seems to not bias towards a specific insect. I have set a uniform prior to keep things fair but one can always vary that I suppose if there is an environmental bias. I do not mean to spoil the results but for a seed(using the Mersenne Twister Pseudo RNG) of 34 and 44, extinction of undesirable and desirable allele can be observed.
